                        You should try to undertrack a strafing opponent. This means trying to track the trailing edge
                        (closest to the center of their strafe) of the opponent and letting them strafe back into your
                        bullets. If you can do this is reduces the reaction time component, as you have the entire time
                        it takes them to move across your crosshair before you have to react to a change of direction.
                        Easier said than done, of course.
                        Both clips you were beaten by AD spam. AD spam has a fixed, mostly symmetrical strafe. If you
                        recognize someone is AD spamming you can cheat more at aiming. You know roughly the area they
                        are going to stick to, so you don't have to track outside this. You can even hold your crosshair
                        mostly steady and just shoot them as they cross it.
                        The smoother you are the easier it is to see what you are aiming at, and the easier it is to
                        track. You were jerking the crosshair around a lot here.
                        One other trick is to look at how you initiate the fight. It's much easier to track them if you
                        start on target. In the first clip they were already AD spamming by the time you were on target.
                        In the second your tracking was slightly off at the start. With a bit more accuracy you could
                        have done 100 to that Ash before they had time to react.
                        I feel I could write an essay on these clips, but I'll stop here. In terms of Kovaaks I have
                        found strafe and dodge scenarios very helpful. Here are some suggestions:
                        Close Mid AD dodge. So many good variants here.
                        VT Patstrafe Intermediate
                        VT Airstrafe
                        Close Mid Strafes Dodge. Mirror and anti-mirror, but anti-mirror is more important IMO because
                        it requires more mouse control
                        MFSI rAim and Prediction Cancelling. Hard strafes to tracks
                        Good luck out there, legend! </li>
